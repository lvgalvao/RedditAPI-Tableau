I know this one is relatively easy and not as valuable as the desktop associate but I’m still proud of myself.
I only studied for an hour and half the week before the exam took place so I had low hopes on passing. 

I’m graduating from college in June and wanted to add a marketable skill to my resume. After building a dashboard during my internship in the summer, I felt motivated to take the exam. But I put off studying until the last minute and other obligations quickly overflowed my to do list. 

The questions I did end up studying were the conceptual ones. They asked about dashboard actions, differences between dimension and measures, joins/unions etc. Some of the hands on questions took me at least 3 minutes to figure out but they are pretty straight forward. I’d say for this part, as long as you have some hands on experience using tableau to create basic visualizations, you should be just fine.

Not with a software itself, I think the software is amazing but with infrastructure changes/ organizational hurdles  you have to go through so that it becomes of any use to your team.

Imagine my situation:

- A company you work for provides you with a license to a Tableau Desktop.

- You get all excited and decide to built a dashboard.

- This dashboard contains mix of your company's sensitive data and daily updated data sources hosted in AWS or GCP BigQuery.

- You spent a week on the development of a beautiful dashboard.

- Once the dashboard is developed you realize that you can't share your dashboard with anyone else because Tableau Reader doesn't support live connections to sources such as BigQuery and you can't use Tableau Public due to sensitive nature of your data.

- Turns out that if you want to share your dashboard with anyone else then your company needs to go through an expensive and lengthy process of purchasing Tableau Server/Tableau Online subscription.

- Now your dashboard development project turns into software procurement project, with all the politics and bureaucracy nightmares associated with trying to persuade several levels of company's non technical bosses to purchase an expensive software subscription. And good luck selling them on this additional expense if your team already has access to something similar like Power BI.

- You give up on your dashboard and Tableau and rebuilt the whole thing with Python using Streamlit. It takes you 3 times as long but your are free to host and deploy your code any way you want.

To summarize I understand that at the end of the day this is Tableau's business model, hook users with an intuitive and pretty desktop app and then sell expensive Tableau Server to actually make it usable.

I joined the company about a year ago and the former BI Analyst handed all tableau ""reports"" to me.

The problem is that, there is not a single visualization, within our reporting (and I am telling the pure truth).

Our tableau dashboards contain only text tables, depicting every metric possible for each stakeholder and it feels like everybody in the company thinks tableau is an auto-updated excel tool.

The think is that for the last 3 months I am supposed to be the tableau guy for the company so every stakeholder is contacts me directly to ask for any new dashboard/report.

The last request that I have, and I don't know how to deal with, is to create a 32*60 pivoted excel-like table, which hill hold our revenue for a selected month broken down to each separate dimensions.

I am trying over 3 weeks to make this possible but it's really hard since there are also some columns that will contain the Year over Year difference.

I think that the way they are thinking for what tableau can do is extremely false, how can I make them understand that tableau is a visualisation tool and not an online excel and which alternative solution could I suggest to fulfill their needs for updated excel tables?

I could spend hours talking about pros and cons of each software, but I can boil it down to two things.

1. Tableau has a better UI and process for designing visualizations and calculations.
2. PowerBI has a data preparation layer that blows default Tableau out of the water.

I have had the opportunity to experiment with a trial of Tableau Prep, but my (rather large) company will not purchase it as an add on. As a result, I have been gravitating towards PowerBI for it's robust data preparation layer that is included by default. It is often times more appropriate than loading an ETL into SQL Server, something I have had to do many times in tableau (I'm looking at you unions between multiple servers).

n1tv3b,tableau,1619789365.0,"Hello Tableau folks,

I would like to share a project I wrote that allow to connect directly to a Jupyter notebook, export dataframe to tableau and refresh data (thus invoking Python code).

It also works for realtime analytics like tabpy, however the code is only in the notebook and can aggregate functions from multiple notebooks in a single endpoint.

The project is named Jupytab, and I also wrote a tutorial to explain how to create a simple MLP simulator on the iris dataset from scratch : [https://btribonde.medium.com/interactive-simulation-with-tableau-and-jupytab-c26adb1be564](https://btribonde.medium.com/interactive-simulation-with-tableau-and-jupytab-c26adb1be564).

Let me know what you think about that and if it can be helpful.

iziqkp,tableau,1601037795.0,"I couple of people have casually suggested I post this here and as the summer comes to an end and the ""app"" as people call it is losing relevancy I think this Friday is a fine time. 

I run a data strategy consultancy. We manage the end to end data life cycle and our front end tool of choice is Tableau. We did a rebrand in April (what a good time to spend a bunch of money eh?) and with that rebrand decided on a locally focused content strategy. So I was doing a lot of targeted analytics like where are all the hiking trails in the province and what our covid cases look like. They performed fine. nothing outstanding but better traction than pre-rebrand. 

One weekend I went to a food truck that people loved. It wasn't there. I discussed this with a friend he said yeah they're so hard to find. So kind of to prove a point I decided to create an excel sheet with where all the food trucks were going to be for the next week. I put Tableau over this and posted it on a Wednesday (when the weekend schedules were mostly cemented). 

People lost their damn minds. It did the rounds on twitter and FB. I had people I know tell me about it not knowing I built it. Two radio stations had me on. The provincial CBC featured and so did an Atlantic Canada online publication. 

It's done 17K hits, expanded to 3 cities (but has since abandoned 1, for some reason the food trucks in my city are VERY mobile but other cities they're fairly stationary). 

Technically it's nothing fancy at all. It's a map of the city with a food truck icon over the location where they will be with a list underneath. Clicking a truck brings up their menu as a URL action. The part I'm most proud of is having a calculated field that does ""Today"", ""Tomorrow"", ""Day After"" based on the current date and using that as the filter, so it's always the right day. It's posted to tableau public and then embedded onto my website. 

The back end is all manual. Which is why I probably won't be doing this again next year. Not that it's a lot of work but it certainly is work. And it was much easier to do on the heels of the shutdown vs now where the NeW NoRMaL is happening and we're quite busy. There are other approaches to getting the data, sure, but none of them are great short of making the vendors do it and maybe I open up the year with that approach in 2021. 

Anyway. Just thought I'd share because some of shown interest and it's Friday and I know a bunch of ya's (me included) want to sink some time down the drain.

pxgtx7,tableau,1632865794.0,"Don't know why I'm thinking about this or if anyone will care but wanted to list every client I've ever 'lost' in my four years as a freelance BI Consultant.

I define ""lost"" as a client I didn't get to complete the work for or where there was an opportunity to re-up with a new client that fell through.

2017 - A British Social Media management agency hired me to dashboard some of their social media KPIs in Tableau. Once onboarded the PM said they didn't have any work yet in Tableau but wanted to know if I could start on a few excel dashboards. I had never done excel dashboarding before but said yolo sure. Delivered three, he said they were all too small. Increased fonts etc. Still to small. Tried one last time and he cut me loose. I never billed him. Hit me like a bag of bricks like 2 weeks later that when I sent them to him I zoomed way out so he could see the whole thing in one view and I never told him this. He clearly didn't know to zoom back in. Oh well excel dashboards truly suck. 

2018 - Australian Homework tutoring service or something. This was my fault because I told him I could do something I couldn't. I said I'd be able to use algorithms to figure out why he couldn't retain tutors. Spoilers I couldn't. I quit without billing him. He wanted me to stay but I was like brah it's not gonna be a good fit. 

2018 - Canadian hardware distribution arm of a Japanese based international retailer. Again hired to do Tableau but Tableau wasn't ready yet. Built some pretty interesting things in SQL, was an awesome spot to get paid to develop my SQL skills. Eventually did do some Tableau stuff but between the Japanese Corporate IT department and local resources they boxed me out of most of it. Contract just fizzled out. They were so overmanaged it was kind of painful, but great billables and happy to pay. 

2019 - The company was in talks of taking on all of the BI for the midwestern Pizza Hut franchises. They hired me as a BI PM to manage the offshore team, but they were at the 20 yard line when they brought me in. The builds were poor and it was already make or break with the client. I made some revisions but it was too little too late. Too bad would have been a wicked project. In the end the franchises cut him, and thus me, loose. Good guy. 

2019 - This Texan guy who moved to Myanmar to do supply chain management for convenience stores. Weirdest (well 2nd weirdest) little project. A ton of fun. Basically had the final say in how the data would look and how we would present it. In the end my Canadian hourly wasn't good ROI for his Myanmar margins so we broke it off. It was also a terrible time difference with only like 3 overlapping hours where we were both awake. 

2019 - A company that managed this scheme where people would go from one dentist to the next buying crowns to be melted down and then sell the gold. Absolutely wild. We kind of just mutually ghosted each other. We'd get on these calls where the guy would just sound off on how bad Tableau was at doing basic things (spoilers they weren't basic). It was like 90 minute calls mostly him ranting. And then they'd cry fowl about budget. 

2020 Pandemic Casualties: Two clients heavily involved in the events space. Both just RIP. And then a third who was doing analytics on Gym memberships. We were already towards the end of that contract and they wanted to move to web-based BI rather than Tableau. So probably wouldn't have gone much longer anyway but as you know gyms weren't eagerly dropping stacks last year either.

2020 - this not for profit local health research funding firm. This one hurt. I was referred to them by a someone I knew, went through the bidding process and won. Was basically spicing up their reports to make them more engaging so was turning them into an info graph. Things were going mostly well and then they got a new CEO. I feel like this was a bigger factor than they let on. But first meeting with him he hated everything. And then we mutually realized I misread the brief. Tried to recover but didn't get there. Left half the budget on the table and they shitcanned me. 

2021 - A Kenyan security company who hired me to do some detailed maps in Tableau. He had already started and I made some enhancements before talking him off of Tableau (it wasn't a great fit for the more advanced Geography stuff he wanted to do)

2021 - A US consultant company working with food point of sale data. Great company, super rushed but a ton of fun. But since I was in Canada they wouldn't give me remote access. So we were sending files with masked data back and forth, swapping data sources in and out and then I had to troubleshoot on different numbers they had. Massive PITA. So spent most of my time just training one of their guys on how to do it which boxed me out of the work. 

2021 - An east coast Restaurant chain. This one has me grumpy because their internal DB sys admin was awful and sunk the project for me. I was putting out good work but this guy wasn't moving the needle. They also had me capped at like 10hours/week and wanted 15 hours of work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/pxgtx7/every_client_ive_ever_lost_as_a_tableaudata/,Every client I've ever lost as a Tableau/data consultant,88,38,0.97,2021-09-28 18:49:54,2021

6. Hold Ctrl and drag a calculation from the pill to anywhere else to copy it - including into your field list to create a new calc field. [2m25s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=2m25s)
7. If you're using measure values on colour, right click the measure values pill and select individual legends per measure. This lets you set a different legend for each measure. But it can get psychedelic so be careful. [2m48s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=2m48s)
8. In a legend, double click a colour to go to the customization GUI [3m00s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=3m00s)
9. To reduce the colour noise, you can use advanced customization to reduce the impact of outliers and stepped legends that reduce the number of total colours. [3m41s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=3m41s)
10. In the toolbar, click analysis, view data. It will show you all of the data in the current worksheet. A quicker way than highlighting all the points and right clicking view data. [4m08s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=4m08s)
11. If you need to export a measure name by measure values table, it will export as a cross tab and not a table (not like it looks in Tableau). To alleviate this, multi select the measures (ctrl + click) and drag them onto the rows. Then multi select again, right click and select dimension. Now you'll see that the export formats as a table. [4m23s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=4m23s)
12. Drag the middle of a range filter to maintain the range but change the end points. [4m48s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=4m48s)
13. Have dynamic colouring in text or tooltip by creating multiple if statement calculated fields, that return the desired value, one for ""bad"" and one for ""good"" each without an else statement. Set them each in the tool tip, colour the bad one Red and the good one Green. Only one will ever show up at a time. [5m25s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=5m25s)
14. Right click on a date, format and scroll down to custom and pick the perfect date format. [6m32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=6m32s)
15. Use map layers to add street or satellite details to a map. [6m51s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=6m51s)
16. To dynamically highlight only one dimension from a group, create a parameter that has all of the dimension options and then a calculated field of Parameter = Dimension. Set that field on colour, and click a bright colour for true and a bland colour for false. Order the legend so that true is on top.[7m24s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=7m24s)
17. You can set a password on a dashboard using a parameter and a calculated field the verifies the Parameter is set to a specific word. [8m34s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=8m34s)
18. Use a Count Distinct of dimensions in a view to swap create a dynamic label that shows either a specific item or lexicon for multiple items, based on filters. IF the count distinct is equal to 1 THEN use Attribute on the dimension to show the specific dimension, ELSE show ""All Products/Teams/Cities"" [9m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=9m53s)
19. On Startup hover across recent files to preview contents by worksheet [10m58s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=10m58s)
20. Ctrl and click multiple worksheets and right click, select copy. You can and paste these worksheets within a workbook to duplicate, or from one workbook to another. It will even bring the datasource with it. [11m21s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdJF-1mV_s&t=11m21s)
21. The 21st trick is that there isn't a 21st trick.

ojp3b3,tableau,1626210679.0,"1 Keep consistent font sizes (and know the hierarchy)

If your KPIs are sz 24 make sure they always are. Titles all the same, subtitles all the same (but smaller). Body text? You got it, man you catch on quick. CSuite love finding font inconsistencies. I swear it's on the ""how to become CSuite"" test. Making everything consistent avoids a dumb discussion about how they aren't consistent


2 Keep consistent alignment

I'm a center guy myself but I know some people who are big on left. Either way if you start with one carry it through the majority of your dashboard. Mismatched alignments trick the eyes and the brain into thinking things are messy

3 Whitespace can be a friend

Ever try to cram as much as possible onto a dashboard. Yeah me too bud. But less can be more. Whitespace pleases our tiny little homosapien brains. Tableau gives  a default padding of 4pt^2 but as my wife has said to me many times ""four pixels isn't very satisfying"". I'll do 8, sometimes 16. And don't forget about inner padding too.

4 Useless colours are useless

I find new Tableau users love to stick a dimension on the colour mark, hit that Tableau default 20 template and boom you've got yourself a bar chart. That's a big HowAboutYouDont from ya boy RH. Use colour sparingly. Don't use the same colours across multiple charts to mean different things. Don't use colour without purpose. And when possible...

5 Match brand colours

This one is biggest for clients/user groups new to Tableau. I've presented some dog shit dashboards for initial feedback and I'll tell you the difference between a very vague wire frame and a very vague wire frame in brand colours is huge. Especially with management. Just seeing they're brand brought into Tableau can really get them excited. 

6 Label everything. As much as possible

Many people are still screengrabbing and emailing your work. Which, whatever, can't win every battle. Even without that it's a better user experience when you're not constantly hovering or trying to align marks to axises. Label as much as possible. But also refer back to bullet 3. if in doubt.

7 Left to right top to bottom

Most of the world reads from left to right and that doesn't stop with words. The story your dashboard is telling will be read that way as well. So put your most important point too left, your more granular info at the bottom. If some information is sequential place it in that order.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/ojp3b3/7_super_simple_formatting_tips_that_will_greatly/,7 super simple formatting tips that will greatly improve any dashboard.,75,10,0.96,2021-07-13 18:11:19,2021

uxhrr5,tableau,1653486449.0,"Here is what consistently trip people up, IMO. 

&#x200B;

1. Dates. Dates dates dates and always dates. I find until you get comfortable with right click + drag Dates can be the most infuriating thing in Tableau. The default date hierarchy in it's own right it's pretty unhelpful. I've used Tableau for 9 years and can count on one finger the times I've used the date hiearchy in a dashboard - and I'd still have a finger left for nose picking. The click path of going from a discrete date to a continuous and back is painful, and I'm exhausted of explaining that the super thin gray line that splits the dates apart is actually the most important concept of that menu. 

&#x200B;

2. The show me is very unhelpful. It's built up to be a very useful tool to quickly build charts but I, personally, find it misleading and more cumbersome than learning the appropriate click paths. I also find it will often do unintended things to my charts that I don't necessarily want. I wish it was better. I wish you could click any chart on it and it would auto build the chart with random dimensions/measures that you could then swap out. THAT would be helpful.

&#x200B;

3. Make the donut a damn default. Donuts are better than Pies (imo) but it's ludicrously cumbersome to get to a donut chart for what should be day 1 stuff. Whenever I show a pie in training the question is ""can we do a donut"" and the answer is yes, but first let me tell you about dual axises, and then let me tell you about creating fake axises in order to trick Tableau. 

&#x200B;

4. We need to make shapes cooperate with text better. It's ... dire. People want arrows on their KPIs, it's 2022. PBI does this automatically. Tableau requires two sheets, especially if you want color on both text and shape.

&#x200B;

5. Get rid of Forecasting and Clustering or do something with it. These two features are long since antiquated and for certain audiences spark interest followed by let downs.

ormsn9,tableau,1627256263.0,"just wanted to share my experience with these two products and why power BI failed for us and why I think tableau is an overall better product.

My company started using tableau about 6 years ago for reporting and dashboards and it worked great except for the cost. The cost was getting to be a problem from a finance perspective and could not continue to justify using it anymore. Back in 2019, we ended our tableau license and moved everything over to Power BI.

Before I go into too much detail about power BI, let me go over how we were using tableau. We had many users from many departments accessing data from various data warehouses and building reports and dashboards within tableau. A lot of times, teams would have their own sql server, mysql or oracle servers and they would use ETL processes to bring that data into their own environments and then let tableau handle the rest. Our users were mainly building flat, wide tables and sending through tableau. This worked perfectly as reporting folks were able to provide lots of reports and insights. Quick table calcs and LODs allowed end users to build some pretty complex calculations without much effort. Bottomline, people were happy and productive.

Fast forward to 2019 and we are all in on power BI and it is freaking nightmare. First, lets start with DAX. Dax is powerful but always insanely complex and non intuitive. Its almost like trying to speak backwards and do everything backwards. Most people hated it. Second, power BI does not play nice with wide, flat tables as they cause performance issues and make calculations in DAX even more complicated than they need to be. Many people did not embrace star schemas and found them to be complicated during the data modeling process. The charts, although easy to build, were very lackluster and boring especially the colors. Tableau has them beat on visuals by a mile. 

After 2 years, we finally gave up and went back to tableau. I know power BI is powerful, but I think you need the right types of people and commitment to make it work. We're slowly getting back to tableau and people are happy again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/ormsn9/from_tableau_to_power_bi_back_to_tableau/,from tableau to power BI back to tableau,72,22,0.98,2021-07-25 20:37:43,2021

* ""It takes forever to load!""
* ""Can you change X, Y, Z on this table for the meeting in 10 mins?"" (often-times making certain ad-hoc changes in Tableau takes a lot longer than when we were using spreadsheets)
* Lots of complaints around why it can't look a very specific way like it did in spreadsheets
* Overall feedback on the trade-off of flexibility for ad-hoc analysis and quick and dirty viz in Excel for less flexible overly complicated viz in Tableau.
* The frustration around attempting to present financial statement information in the structure of a financial statement (income statements never look like income statements in Tableau without lots of work-arounds, which defeats the purpose)
* During presentations, there can be this 10sec pause while the viz is loading during a presentation due to connection slowness (feels like an hour)

For example, with a dual axis, you can't hide the bottom header, but you can hide the top.  

The 'workaround' is to remove axis ticks, labels and title from the bottom, but it still sucks because you have to account for this big ugly space at the bottom.  

And spell check?  A feature that's been around for decades ... yet you have to use a workaround here.  Copy / paste your text into a word document or something.

How to: 

**Setting up the email action** is easy enough. Under dashboard actions, select hyperlink and in the url use the following syntax [(shout out)](http://blog.clickdimensions.com/pre-fill-an-email-created-via-mailto-link/)

mailto:<Employee Email>?cc=<Supervisor Email>&subject=<AGG(Email Subject)>&body=<AGG(Email Body)>  

I've created a calculated field specific for each field I'm including in the email. You can also just do this on the fly, but I thought this was more organized and helpful for this walk through. 

**Creating the body** and subject can be as complicated or easy as you want. You can have a simple sentence like ""Hey just following up on this lead"" or you can go a bit overboard. Since I was procrastinating doing real work, I did the latter.

f2v59m,tableau,1581530238.0," I've been obsessed with building a Calendar in Tableau. I've tried more than once to sneak it into a clients dashboard, but it's receptions rarely matches my enthusiasm for it.   


Today, amidst some tremendous procrastination, I've finally built myself a top tier interactive Calendar. In my opinion, anyway.   
Tableau public link at the bottom.   


&#x200B;

Who is this view for? I think the best example, which I don't have great data for, is for future planning. I had an event planning client who could see upcoming room capacity by day. Or shift scheduling for a workforce. But the Calendar works well enough for past results too. I've done hours worked by day. You could also do Revenue, Net, Orders, Customers. Any of your KPIs, really, but you'd want something that occurs Daily. New Hires, for example, might be a bad fit. Anyway. I digress. Let's look at a picture. 

[Jpeg 1](https://www.offthechartsconsulting.com/uploads/1/0/8/9/108989971/2020calendar_1_orig.png)

Staging the Data  
This is a view of every day this year, and how many hours I've worked on that day. It's also showing future dates with no hours. That's one of the first steps to setting up this type of view. You TYPICALLY need a second table. It's just one column, and it's every day in the calendar time frame. I have an excel sheet that runs from Jan 1 2017 to Dec 31 2021. Every day needs to be represented, past and future. This is then right joined to your data on the date in your dataset. If you don't do this, your calendar will be missing days where no activity occurs in your business. Some databases might have a record regardless of activity, but that's certainly the exception not the rule. 

[Jpeg 2](https://www.offthechartsconsulting.com/uploads/1/0/8/9/108989971/datasetup_orig.png)

Building the sheets  
​I'll go over the sheets themselves. I've build a single sheet and once happy with it duplicated it 3 times, and switched the months.   
​

[Jpeg 3](https://www.offthechartsconsulting.com/uploads/1/0/8/9/108989971/tableview_orig.png)

1 - The columns. These are straight forward. The only thing worth calling out is to make sure you use the Date Field from your custom table that has every date. Otherwise you'll be missing the data on days that don't exist in your database. To get WEEKDAY you right click on the month dimension pill, go to 'More' and select Weekday. I then did a bit of formatting on my headers.   


2- Filters. The Month filter just narrows down how many Months I show on a sheet. I originally went with Quarters but if you are anti scrolling, as I am, four wide/three long does better than three by four. So I scrapped quarters and hard filtered to four month intervals.   
Only One Year - this is tied to a yearly parameter that lets the user switch. In hindsight a single value select filter on Year(EveryDay) would have been fine.   


3 - Marks. The colour is a calc field. You could easily just prop your measure on there but I wanted a bit more control so I created a calc field that lets me hardcode my colour steps. It also allows me to switch measures using a second parameter.   
Day(EveryDay) is on the text mark and is formatted to be top right. This gives the calendar look of having only the day in each box.   
The rest of this stuff is for the tool tip. You can add the measure into the text box, bottom left. It's a good look, but I found it a bit too crowded and took it out. If you don't mind the scroll then this is a good tradeoff.   


4- Rows: Week in month is actually a slightly complex calc to give you how many weeks are in each month. I stole it from the forums.   
IF DATEPART(""weekday"", DATETRUNC(""month"", \[EveryDay\])) = 1  
THEN INT((DATEPART('day',\[EveryDay\])-DATEPART('weekday',\[EveryDay\])+7)/7)  
ELSE INT((DATEPART('day',\[EveryDay\])-DATEPART('weekday',\[EveryDay\])+7)/7)+1 END  


Dashboard  
So after duplicating the sheet 3x and fixing the filter to bring different months on each, add all the sheets to the dashboard. The only stickhandling I did here was use a vertical layout container and select ""distribute evenly"" to make sure the charts all occupied the same amount of space. Then add the parameters in. One toggles measures from clients to hours, the other changes the year.   


Flair  
I've also add a viz in tooltip to show year over year per day. Actually pretty happy with this one. I think it looks great and gives a bit more functionality. On my internal dashboard I've added a second tooltip that shows all the hours I did on that day, and who was billed what.

vzohlb,tableau,1657890958.0,"Half a decade ago (sounds bigger like that) while working full time for provincial government I formalized the paper work to incorporate my consulting business. At the time I was ok at Tableau, had an understanding for data and really just wanted to viz all day (which my gov job didn't let me do).

I moonlighted for 3 months and quit my gov job in October when I had enough work to make it full time. I've since added two part time employees + a handful of hired guns here and there for things I'm bad at. First clients were from Reddit, Upwork and Freelancer - but more recently I survive off of people who find me on social media (twitter and linkedin) and referrals. 

 72 Clients, from across Canada, US, Australia, Barbados, Kenya... 11 countries.

Today I still do a lot of Tableau work, but I also do a lot of purely database work as well as Alteryx and corporate training. It's really a bit of everything, which is what I enjoy.

What I'm proudest of: This month I'll have done work for 5 clients that I onboarded in the first year of business. I love getting good feedback, but what I love more are the clients who choose to grow with me. Those that have trusted me enough to embed me in their business.  


Strangest project: Door to door dental clinic sales people that would buy crowns from the dentists to re-sell the metal (in bulk) to smelting companies.   


Hardest Project: Gym Membership revenue growth, trying to bucket gym goers into different personas and then suggest upsells based on that persona for a few gym chains in New England. Fun project, but the backend Postgress logic was a challenge ( a lot of Partition Row Over, which was new to me at the time), as was the dashboard.  


Biggest L: Early days, hired as a Tableau Dev, but client said no projects for Tableau yet could I do excel dashboards. Said sure (lie), did my best, sent to him. Reply : everything is so small. Ok, pump up the sizes, resend. Same feedback. Eventually got fired. Realized after the fact I was always zooming out before send to get everything on one screen. Forgot to mention it, oops.  

Biggest W: last year I created, marketed and sold out a 2 hour in person training about data viz best practices.   


Best Feedback: ""The people at NATO think this dashboard is really great"" (NATO (yes that one) were a partner of the client's client, but still cool, imo)  


\#1 Tip: Anyone can learn tech. Anyone can learn business. Only you can be you. Everything aside, what differentiates me from my competition is me. Strive to be someone people will want to work with. In networking, in sales, be yourself, sell yourself. It's fluffy, but it's true.

Mine was this executive KPI dashboard that was had three by three ""zones"" and in each zone was 8 KPIs and 8 arrows. 

What made it so crappy is that each ""zone"" was a square with rounded corners and each KPI had to sit in its own smaller square with rounded corners. And yes this was a hard requirement.

am8z6r,tableau,1549068952.0,"**The environment...**

* Sucks.
* No external monitor allowed, so you're going back and forth between Tableau and the test, both of which are on a virtual machine (test is through Firefox on the VM)
* The virtual machine is a PC, operating in chrome, which is a bummer for us Mac users. *The interface is a little different on PC.*
   * it's hard to remember not to use shortcuts. I kept accidentally kicking myself out of full screen, which burns down the clock as the proctor gets involved.
* There is lag
* You have to show the proctor your room. No talking, no cell phones, clear workspace etc
* you can't open the source data in excel, only in tableau
* you can google whatever you want, and navigate tableau... just no live interaction with others (i.e. no posting a question to reddit). Based on the questions, I didn't find it valuable to use google.

**The test & questions...**

* It's pretty easy. This is coming from someone who has been learning solely with the free resources on tableau's site for a few weeks, in my spare time
   * it helps to have excel background just because tableau is pretty intuitive if you are decent with excel and various chart types
* it's 30 questions, but there's a lot of ""select all that apply"", so it was actually 78 total possible points.
   * I.e. if you select 2 answers in a 'select all that apply' question but there are actually 3 correct options, you'd get 2 of 3 points. So you want to focus on getting those questions right as they provide more potential points than the single answer questions.
* If you're *stuck* on a question that requires you to create a viz or dashboard, save it for the end, though I had plenty of time.
   * reason being, those questions are valued as 1 point just like any other single option question, but they are more time consuming
* Like most tests, be prepared for some dumb questions that don't actually test your abilities.
   * i.e. In tableau, where can you go to do XYZ (select all that apply)... which is fine and all, but pretty stupid because most of us will stick to one way that we're comfortable and quick with. This is an easy way to lose points if you get it wrong, but it's worth it to spend a little time to navigate for all the options
* The difficulty of the questions seemed to be mixed between the sample questions in the specialist and qualified associate guides.
   * the only real difference being that the questions requiring you to create a viz have more steps to arrive at the answer in the qualified associate guide. The ones in the specialist guide are a fair example of what's in this test, and I didn't come across anything too difficult
* There's some stuff in there that can be done much quicker than the way they want you to do it
   * even trivial stuff like ""change this measure format to currency and make a chart to show XYZ. Which widget has the lowest cost?""... you obviously don't need to change the measure to currency, just read the question as a whole and figure out the answer the fastest way you know how.
   * I came across a couple instances where they said to make a dashboard, but you could do it in an existing viz and skip multiple steps to arrive at the answer with a couple filters. Again, read what they want as an answer, not necessarily how they want you to get there.

If I could do it over again, I'd probably spend a little more time learning and just go for the qualified associate, but it was interesting to see the format.

I am connecting to the same data sources to compare, but for some reason Tableau Prep is taking much longer time to fetch the data. I understand that, it needs some time to create an overview, and all the stuff that it does, but after half an hour of waiting, the data is not yet loaded! Even though my data source was only around 30 000 records.

But that's not all, even when the data are fully loaded, I still get only a sample of my data set? How am I suppose to clean my data if I don't see all unique values? How can I group 'Europe', 'EU' and 'Europa' together if I can only see 'Europe', which is not even the most common value? And not, I am not using the option for sample data, I have selected Full Data, and I selected this option before I started with the cleaning steps.. I figured, I can select only one column at a time, this will actually show me all unique values. But this is quite annoying, I can do it for some testing, but not every time when I have data to clean up.

I honestly, don't know what is happening and I already hate this thing. I love the idea behind it but the execution is the worst.

Hey, I did an AMA on my 1+2 year anniversaries, and it got decent interest so thought I'd come round again.

About me - I worked as a technical BA for four years before changing jobs in May 2017. But my new job was a bit of a dud. So I started looking for freelance work in my passion of getting people to effectively use their data instead of you know, not. By October 2017 I had enough contracts to feel comfortable ditching my new job.

This years wins

* The Pandemic didn't literally kill me or my business (yet, to both)
* Did a total rebrand
* Was able to let go of a few things and allow others to step in and help

This years Ls

* spent a bunch of money during a global recession.
* Got fired from a contract for the first time
* Still working too much

FAQs

Cool but, like, what exactly do you do?: Primarily back and front end data development. So database management/querying and Tableau/PBI to dashboard results. Ill also do some high level strategy planning (so road mapping a data journeys) and some training/curriculum development.

How did you get your first client: Reddit, before I was looking for clients. They posted here looking for help, and I introduced myself. We've worked together since.

How did you get other clients: Reddit, Upwork, Freelancer (Only once, never again), LinkedIn (inbound), Referrals, Twitter (inbound). With the new website I'm going to try and get back into content gen +SEO. My old site/brand wasn't efficient for this.

Biggest advice to landing clients: Have something you can share. All my work is under NDA but I take time to work with public data so I can share some of my work.

Tableau 2020.3 Beta is out since a few hours, and here are some the new features that made it to this version. 

______________

* **Export Crosstab as Excel on the Web.**

This will please a lot of people. You can now natively create a button to export a sheet as a crosstab in the Excel format (.XLS), keeping your cells and numbers formating. I couldn't test it right away since you have to use it on Server or Online, but [here](https://i.imgur.com/cdKGXNm.gif) is what it looks like in Tableau Desktop. When clicked, it prompts you to select which sheets you want to download.

* **IN Operator in Calcs**

Gone are the days when you had to use [over 9000 OR](https://i.imgur.com/JVQlZ81.png) in a calculated field. The IN function now works in Tableau. The calculated field below will display TRUE if Category is either Furniture, Office Supplies, or Technology:

    IF [Category] IN ('Furniture','Office Supplies','Technology') 
    THEN TRUE END
It also works with Sets:

     IF 'Aaron' IN Set1
    THEN TRUE END

* **Relationship Calculations**

After the great addition of relationships in 2020.2, we can now change the operator between fields. One exemple [here](https://i.imgur.com/kGzlZ6J.png).

* **The ability to write prepared data from Tableau Prep to a database.**

For Tableau Prep users, [this](https://i.imgur.com/lD2YVE6.png) can be a game changer. List of supported databases so far [here](https://i.imgur.com/BkyxdyY.png).


Overall a rather small update but with some great quality of life changes.

On top of that, I try to anticipate follow-up questions that might arise from answering A, B, and C, by also providing insights into D, E, and F. Going above and beyond; our customer loves it. But behind the scenes, my manager keeps criticizing it, saying that “What if I want to know this? And then this? And then what if they ask this?” And just keeps making this simple and easy-to-use dashboard more and more convoluted. I understand we need to continue to improve on it and come out with iterations that are better than the previous, but most of these questions are just completely hypothetical and our customers never ask for those kpi’s or metrics.

I've created a new data visualisation podcast, where I interview top creators about one of their popular vizzes. You get to learn about how they approached making them, tips and tricks they share and get inspired from their journey using Tableau.

The first guest is Kasia Gasiewska-Holc who made an amazing Tableau Public dashboard on plastic pollution in the ocean. She shares her neat technique for creating looped animations in this viz, which is super interesting. I hope it helps some of you here on this subreddit!

akhxix,tableau,1548636202.0,"So, I posted earlier today under a different topic but an interesting discussion arose that I felt like warranted it's own thread. 

I often look through the public Tableau Gallery and see some pretty amazing dashboards/visualizations. They are beautiful and eye-catching and are obviously done by some very talented people. However, I often find them being incredibly narrow-focused relative to what a dashboard would need to be in a corporate sense. 

For example, a public gallery dashboard main want to answer one question (ie. ""How do the top 100 richest people spend their money?""), while a corporate level dashboard may want 10 different KPI's measured/accessible at once (ie. Where is our revenue coming from? Which products are doing well? Where is our market potential? How are we trending? etc, etc, etc). 

So, my TLDR; how do you handle this tension? You may want to practice some really awesome narrow-focused Vizzes at-home for the public space, but almost never have I found that these sort of dashboards are what is needed/asked for in the corporate setting? 

&#x200B;

It is like going to the movies for the pleasure (the public gallery) versus going to the movies to write a report on the character development and how it connects to society (corporate level dashboard), if that makes sense....

Like your color scheme?  Well, hopefully you don't want to keep it when you publish to [PowerBi.com](https://PowerBi.com) because sometimes the server will make a new, unalterable choice for you. 

Want to move the ordering of your legend?  Too bad!  It is alphabetical or nothing.  

Want to vary the size of your graph objects based on an empirical value?  Sorry.  Maybe next year, even though you could do this with Tableau fucking six goddamn years ago.  

Want a dual axis?  It's a total pain in the ass!  

Want to stack multiple dimensions onto your visualization?  Gotta create a hierarchy here and a hierarchy there.  Lord forbid you just drag your goddamn dimensions onto the canvas to see how it looks and have the tool stack 'em for you, like you could since Tableau 1.

Want row banding outside of a fucking spreadsheet build, 'visualization'?  Too bad!  

Want to visualize based on shape?  No!  Custom shapes?  Maybe in 2022.  

Yes, the marketplace for visualization types is cool, but it is necessary because there are so many things you cannot do with out of the box Power BI because it is so inflexible.

1. [https://www.udemy.com/course/tableau-accelerate-your-career-and-get-certified/](https://www.udemy.com/course/tableau-accelerate-your-career-and-get-certified/) \- comes with 3 practice tests.  if you can pass the practice tests, you are ready to sit for the CA test.
2. [https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tableau-bootcamp-dashboards/](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tableau-bootcamp-dashboards/) \- my second favorite course aimed at beginners.  has a terrific section on LOD calcs.

Working through those two courses helped me brush up on stuff I don't use much in my day-to-day.  Also, you don't need to have EVERYTHING memorized for the CA test.

Frequently, people ask me for sales data, usually in Excel/CSV with no context and I simply provide it, and/or develop self-service tools so users can investigate their own leads.  Creating tools has worked well and I've killed 95% of simple requests this way.  I'm constantly building more and more complex tools now, which I enjoy because I'm learning.

However, I frequently find that even with these tools many senior/established colleagues still ask me to get their data for them because they aren't confident and don't wish to commit to learning how to operate a simple interface.  My manager tells me to just do it for them, and he is actually the biggest of them.  Also, we don't have licenses for all colleagues so I can't actually make everyone use it.  

I'm targeted on getting users on board, however at my last Tableau training session, more than half my class quit just before it started due to some 'urgent situation' so I'm still stuck at operating my own tools for them.

There was definitely a sense of unease about it, and an understandable apprehension about celebrating anything, in light of what had happened just a week or so prior. In an effort to try and do something positive, I reached out to Tableau to see about blood donation or volunteer opportunities, and the community decided to jump on board. Soon I had received DMs and emails from quite a few people wondering how they could help out, and before I knew it I was organizing a group of people. We came up with a couple hashtag possibilities, so that anyone who wanted to get info could have a central place to get ahold of it. I got in touch with someone from the Tableau Foundation, and soon thereafter found out that Tableau would be willing to match donations that were made at the Tableau Store during conference. I received an email from Adam Selipsky that was sent out to all conference attendees, and among the points that he made was a mention of the efforts being made by the community, and he directed people to our hashtag for further information about how to get involved.

At conference, there was an area at the entrance to the Tableau Store where people could make donations in whatever size they wanted. What began as a few donations turned into many, and with the combined efforts of attendees, Tableau, and all of the sponsors that matched and made donations of their own, we were able to raise **$120,536** in just 4 days!

&#x200B;

I am about to host my first event as a Tableau User Group Leader here in Greensboro, NC  in three days. We're doing a segment called ""Have a Job/Need a Job"" where job seekers(and havers) get to introduce themselves which got me thinking about how tough it is to land your first job in a new industry. 

&#x200B;

The ""Have a Job/Need a Job' segment is such an amazing work around from the typical ""We need 3-5 years of experience"" jargon that HR departments seem to universally be putting out(although when I was looking it was 3 years ago so maybe things have changed???) for an entry level job. I just wanted to give my perspective as someone who now is over the ""3 year sacred threshold"".'

&#x200B;

1. Job hunting shouldn't be a passive act. You need to get out and network! ""But we're techy analysts who hate that right?"" Get over it! Also, not all networking events are created equal. I'm making a huge effort for my group to not as lame as the networking events that haunt my memory. In hindsight, these were leads groups and it felt very transactional. A good user group can be a place where you learn with other people similar to you and the networking feels secondary and much more natural.'
2. Networking gets such a scummy wrap but I would reframe it as relationship building. These are people that you can help and can help you but they are still people. Remember that. They are not just pawns in the game of getting a job. I think people can really tell when you see them as a tool to get what you want.
3. Don't get overly down on yourself. I was sitting on a panel with a hiring manager a year ago and she said something that really struck me. She looks for people with no experience and skill but the right attitude. She wants to find people who she can mold into her ideal direct report. She doesn't want to work through someone's bad habits. She wants a clean slate. So having no experience can, in a round about way, be a selling point. 

&#x200B;

I made a vlog this weekend that talks through some specific tactics to land a Tableau job. Here's the link if you are curious: [https://youtu.be/3ISraz6eaUI](https://youtu.be/3ISraz6eaUI)

puou8j,tableau,1632505478.0,"A few days ago, I [asked this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/nn8oe7/whats_missing_in_tableau_coursestutorials/) what is missing in Tableau tutorials and courses. There were some common themes in what people find most challenging (details later in this post). So I took it as a challenge to create one explainer video. Of course, I realized how it helped me understand the concept even better. Soon enough, 1 video recording turns into a few videos and then a few video turn into a complete course. 

In this post I intend to share the summary of my learnings.  

First and foremost, if you have not heard [Feynman technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Technique), please check it out. It essentially means that the best way to learn is to explain things to others. 

And boy, this couldn't be more correct. 

Despite 10+ years of work experience, attending & speaking at Tableau conferences, and following the great work of Zen Masters, I couldn't have overestimated how much I knew about Tableau. Just to give you one example, I lacked a good understanding of how Tableau's relationship feature works. It is a  fantastic piece of capabilities in SQL generation. 

&#x200B;

It is only after you start writing it down, creating a PowerPoint, or recording that video, you realize how you (or at least, I )  lack the clarify of thought. So I encourage you to adopt this method. 

&#x200B;

Going back to the common challenging topics. 

&#x200B;

* SQL - why it is needed, how it impacts dashboard performance
* Data Sources  - ""What is the SQL for that report"". This statement comes from the 90s. Your reports do not (and should not) have a SQL. It is part of the data source. The data source itself can be embedded or published
* How to Design Great Dashboard - Everyone wants shiny objects. Not everyone gets to be Jony Ive. Instead, how can we make design process accessible for the artistically challenged. I am talking about the style guide, templates, and layout.
* Excel & Tableau - ""Can you give me that Tableau data in Excel format?"" You have heard it before. We can never win the battle against Excel (hey, its a different tool that allows data manipulation). Let us understand the strength and weaknesses of the tools.

Turns out, the managers interviewed 30+ people who all had the minimum of at least one Tableau certification. My manager said they went with me because my dashboards were both functional, pretty, and easy to understand whereas some other candidates had the technical ability but their vizzes were ugly and didn’t have the look/feel that the managers were after.

However it has come to a point where I need to start looking at alternatives. The main driver is the cost and licensing structure. Since we didn’t spend millions on an unlimited licensing deal, we got to hand out licenses to users to view the dashboard. This has led to a bad user experience with the users getting an error message when they don’t have a license. They then have to raise a request get the approval for the spend and then they can see the dashboard. This particular dashboard needs to be open to the whole org too. 

So the question: what would be a good alternative? I am considering a direct competitor like PowerBI or back to basics with a Python library like HighCharts. I love the flexibility and quick turnaround with Tableau so PowerBI sounds good however I don’t want to have another gotcha moment with a vendor built product so maybe building it from scratch in Python or JS?

I am new to both python and tableau but am embarking on a little project to practice using both (required for work). What I'm trying to do is create some economic charts.

And some are more complicated like using a statistical model to calculate the output.  With anything the requires a calculation it would be nice to have flexibility to change or add variables.

Hey. I work as an HR data analyst and have been at this job (first job) since May 2019 (about a year at end of May). I started using Tableau for the first time back in August to develop HR metric trends. I’ve developed a few dashboard for recruitment and for displaying general metrics, but I am struggling with scaling my work.

The first major problem that I have is my current process flow. As of now, I am exporting my data from Oracle HCM database into an excel file. After some manipulation, I then upload this on a monthly basis for refresh. But this process is laborious and very prone to errors. Not to mention, I maintain my own recruitment/new hire tracker offline, and then I have a separate excel file for the tableau upload. I have to reconcile my data between each files every month. 

So improving my workflow so it can be scalable is my first major problem. A solution might be to having to re-create reports in Oracle and improving the process by ensuring the data spits out accuracy, and then simply refresh.

The second problem is knowing how AND what to display as the most important actionable KPIs for managers. As of now, I am displaying basic metrics for recruitment such as how many hires we’ve had YTD and by source (LinkedIn, Glassdoor), the cost comparison between this point in time last year, and the number and % of new added positions versus how many we backfilled, along with filters. This dashboard is great if you are a beginner and all, but it doesn’t go into important insight or detail that a manage can use and act on. But again, struggling to understand what are important indicators to display and how I should display them. 

**Tl;dr:** I work in HR as a data analyst. I need advice on how I can improve my workflow process (exporting files from Oracle and uploading to Tableau), improve data refresh each month, and understanding what are the most important KPIs to display/deliver to managers (regarding HR recruitment) and how to display those indicators.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/gdf4o8/my_dashboards_are_a_joke_how_can_i_improve/,My dashboards are a joke; how can I improve?,29,31,0.96,2020-05-04 13:48:12,2020

ayxa2c,tableau,1552089919.0,"Tableau was a game changer for interactive data visualisation and analysis.

I don't think it's been quite as strong as an enterprise BI platform. I manage Tableau and Server at my company, and I find all kinds of problems which make me wonder what they're thinking.

What do you guys think?

Some of the things I find problematic:

1) Your ""Content"" is not really integrated on the ""Platform"". It is still just basically hosting Workbooks that you've authored on the client, and thus you can't manage the guts of your content from the Server. E.g.

a) You can't do a query to audit which fields are used in your content, or what calculated field definitions are.   
(You would have to download all your workbooks and scan them to do this).

b) You can't even do a query which basically identifies if a particular view is showing no records, or even has a broken datasource.  
(I would need to write a script to scrape my site to do this!).

c) The biggest aspect of this is Published Data Extracts. WTH are they thinking? Working with these is insane. To edit extracts, even little updates, I have to do this on Desktop, then publish to server. Extract on server might be gigabytes. (Cue massive tricks and hacks with parameters and calculated fields to publish empty extracts, which the server then refreshes.)

You could say that Tableau Server is not a real BI platform, you can't edit or see your content properly on it.

It is just serving blindly serving content that you have to manage in the Desktop to see properly.

&#x200B;

3) I still can't work out how to do realtime/low-latency auto-refreshing dashboards sanely.

(Best solution seems to wrapping a dashboard in html page and using javascript to continually refresh extract on a schedule).

&#x200B;

4) Broken table sorting. Never going to be fixed. My biggest pet gripe.

People have been crying for ""Excel Like"" Sorting since 2013. 

Details at: [https://community.tableau.com/ideas/2767?signin=5f97560fb97e35d3f9c80b6492e93168](https://community.tableau.com/ideas/2767?signin=5f97560fb97e35d3f9c80b6492e93168)

If you have a text table with multiple dimensions and a measure, people expect to be able to click on the sort icon above the measure and have it sort the records by that value. Like it does in Excel and every other BI tool ever made. Except Tableau. 

The problem is that Tableau always treats a text table as hierarchical structure, and so will usually sort by the rightmost, inner, dimension. Which 99% is useless and not what you want. The sorting works the expected way if you only have 1 dimension. It's not just that this essential functionality isn't there, it's worse because there is a button there which users expect to behave a standard way, but which does nothing.

Despite the ""Planned"" badge on the idea, I have actually spoken with the Tableau Product Management team and I realised that this is never going to happen. They just don't believe that tables in Tableau should work the way they do in the rest of the universe. (The solution might have been to differentiate between a text table and a ""table grid"" or whatever which acts the way people want it to.)

Anyway, I am reduced to never creating tables with more than one dimension. I have seriously considered finding other solutions to handle reporting where users want to interact with textual data rather than visual data.

Creating ONE dashboard that has the data necessary for multiple stakeholders (Executive-level down to field-level) with varying goals.

For the executive, more granular details and insights aren’t needed and can be seen as overwhelming and a “data dump” rather than storytelling.

For field-level users, the more broad/overview data and visuals are not useful, as they prefer the granular details.

The main painpoint: None of them from the executive all the way down to the field know exactly what they want from the dashboard (as this is all new with the data that’s just been lying around before). Countless interviews with them leads to varying needs and uncertainty as to what the potential of the data even holds, so they are trusting us to create the dashboard.

What we’ve done so far was create a main dashboard that encompasses more of the broader trends and rollups of the data. And within it, there are links/tabs to other dashboards that dig into the details.

Hello! I have my first job interview in two weeks for a Data Analyst position. However, the role puts major emphasis on understanding Tableau, and being able to build reports and visualizations by connecting to a database. I have an understanding of SQL and Tableau foundation skills, however, I've never really connected to a database source on my own.

I just have completed the [Udemy Tableau foundation course](https://www.udemy.com/tableau10/) and am moving on to the advanced course soon. Below are the concepts that I have learned, but I am curious if this is enough and any other advice you could give me.

&#x200B;

* Install Tableau Desktop 10
* Connect Tableau to various Datasets: Excel and CSV files
* Create Barcharts
* Create Area Charts
* Create Maps
* Create Scatterplots
* Create Piecharts
* Create Treemaps
* Create Interactive Dashboards
* Create Storylines
* Understand Types of Joins and how they work
* Work with Data Blending in Tableau
* Create Table Calculations
* Work with Parameters
* Create Dual Axis Charts
* Create Calculated Fields
* Create Calculated Fields in a Blend
* Export Results from Tableau into Powerpoint, Word, and other software

* Adding Filters and Quick Filters
* Create Data Hierarchies
* Adding Actions to Dashboards (filters & highlighting)

* Advanced Data Preparation (including latest updates in Tableau 9)",https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/avr071/help_i_have_my_first_tableau_job_interview/,HELP! I have my first Tableau job interview!,27,24,0.94,2019-02-28 10:15:26,2019
9odbge,tableau,1539614847.0,"This is something I wrote for my LinkedIn feed, but thought you guys would probably be more interesting in it than anyone there. Two of my clients have Red Brands and they both do KPIs differently, which got me thinking of this topic. Anyway... read on if you want.

Ah, red. The colour best known for Christmas, blood and when your KPIs have gone horribly horribly wrong. It's also the primary shade in some of the world's biggest brands such as Coca-Cola, Toyota and Verizon.

Well, what do you do when you have to balance a company's branding with a functional KPI color palette? In one of the most pedantic things I've ever written, I present to you the dos and don'ts of building your red branded KPI dashboards (please don't tell my younger self this is what my life is now).

1 - DON'T use Red for bad. If you're presenting to an executive, a real company man, you don't want their brand to mean things are in the gutter. You might not care, but it will get noticed. Instead use a black or gray. Something neutral.

2 - DON'T use too much red. This is dashboard not the end of a Jack Bauer rampage. Too much red is an affront on the visuals and is almost impossible to work with.

3 - DON'T corner yourself into using colours that are relevant to the competition. It can work, but if it doesn't, throw it out.

[Here is my DON'T Dashboard.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQEB1M_oDnldyQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=977MvMRaD7OLgm6dEIqmMNHw2-FWxJW8WF5SAr2tZzU)


The numbers line up to my points above. The headings contain a lot of red, it's all branded but hard to take in. The charts on the left use red to represent the brand while the charts on the right use red to represent bad. Which could create the mental fallacy of Brand = Bad. It might sound silly, but that does happen. The bottom right bar chart uses political party colours to help readers instinctively know what is what, but it's bright and out of place to the rest of the palette.

[Here's my DO dashboard](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHsUtYkcHZGMQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=P44Y8G9uH0ygyaKP6vXfkAK9rcE1yj5zE7VUa9ZySqQ), and I'll explain some of my changes afterwards.

You'll notice right away (hopefully) that you're not blinded by red. But there is still enough to consider the dashboard branded. Replacing the bar chart with a line helps as it gives more white space. The right hand tables have a gray base and, where it's obvious, red as positive. I've not done this for the by province chart as it was not intuitive here that red was good (since there are no labels or legends).

I think my favorite change is to the % of Revenue by Year. I love color coding with party colors as it's intuitive for the user. Unfortunately I think it distracts. This version flows much better and you don't lose much in terms readability.

So. That was bland. Not many get the joys of restless nights thinking how do make an appealing red branded dashboard. But maybe, just maybe, this will inspire someone working with palettes in the future. And if not, I appreciate you sticking it out with me anyway.

http://www.datavizmyths.com/

So what is this new site about i hear you ask? Well i am glad you asked. 

There are many rules and guidelines around dataviz. Everyone knows the rule, but not necessarily the origin and the logic behind it. What started out as a guideline becomes a rule that gets blindly followed without understanding why. Over time, these rules become mantras and doctrine that people follow religiously, and enforce when they see others straying from the path. However as their origins have been lost in the mists of time, often this advice or criticism is un-warranted. 
 This website aims to explore the myths surrounding dataviz and look for the truth behind them. To show what the rule actually means, when to apply it and when to disregard it. I want to show that it’s not enough to just know the rule, you have to know the reason why it exists in the first place, know when to bend it and not break it.

Over time i will add more myths to the list, the aim is for this to become the dataviz myth busting reference site. So, if you have a myth that you want exploring and ultimately busting, let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/4ad8jf/introducing_my_new_site_datavizmythscom/,Introducing my new site DataVizMyths.com,28,4,1.0,2016-03-14 11:14:33,2016
